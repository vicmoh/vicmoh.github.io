                <p>Treelea is a community founded on a vision: to create a world with more neighbours and less strangers where it’s easy to get what you need.</p>
                <p>In the beginning we came together with a rebellious spirit to trade things out of necessity. We learned that people were inherently kind and that by leaning on each other we could make city living easier.</p>
                <p>Since then Treelea has continued to evolve. In addition to trading goods and services you’ll now find people sharing: Local news and events, apartments and rooms for rent,
                job opportunities, recommendations and advice, and more!</p>
                <p>Whether it’s a houseplant or vintage sweater, a roommate or place to call home there’s a good chance you’ll find it on Treelea as our community continues to grow.</p>
